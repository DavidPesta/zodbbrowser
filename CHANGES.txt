- Change background color of links on hover, to make it clear what
  object you'll see when you click, especially when the __repr__ shown
  contains reprs of subobjects.
- Show size of containers next to their representation, e.g.
  "<persistent.dict.PersistentDict object at 0xad0b3ec> (0 items)".
- Pay attention when __name__ is declared as a class attribute (LP#484899).
