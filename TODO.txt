====

- Command-line option to specify port or host:port to listen on
- Command-line option to specify a htpasswd file name for protection
- Figure out how to start the standalone app without actually loading any
  objects from the ZODB
- Audit source code and verify that code of persistent objects is never
  called (except maybe for __repr__ methods).
